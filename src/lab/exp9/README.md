# Multiplers

This lab allows you to design and simulate any digital combinational or sequential circuit. Following instruction help you build the counter circuit. A Javascript-based basic tool and simulation enigne is at the hear of this laboratory. You can create many circuits and test them with fixed or time-varying input signals. You can also see the outputs as values or time-varying waveforms.

Following instruction & above diagram will help you build the circuit.
The right side consist of circuit board and Left side consists the input panel.

* Circuit Board -

	1. The toolbox on the left of the circuit board contains the pre-made logic circuits you will require to build a 4 bit multiplier.

	2. Drag them on the right, to place them on your breadboard.

	3. The left part of the abstracted circuit contains the inputs, and the right side the outputs.

	4. Click on the circle of the input or output to another input/output to make a connection.

	5. The "DC" icon outputs digital 1 at all times, connnect it to:

	* -push on: to simulate the 1 only when you're pressing on the button

	* -push off: to simulate 0 when you're pushing the button

	* -toggle: to toggle the output between 1 and 0.

	6. The OSC supplies 1 and 0 at frequency 1 Hz.

	7. The joint icon is just a connection, to make your connections look neater, as the lines from an output to an input are straight.

	8. The DSO displays the output in a graph format for easy verification. It has default 6 inputs.

* Input panel -

	1. Clear button to clear the circuit board.

	2. Load_it button loads the circuit which is selected from the dropdown.

	3. Click on the circle of the input or output to another input/output to make a connection.

	* You can connect only one line to an input, but an output can have multiple lines.

	4. If your are facing issue creating the circuit please go through thoery section or try using the inbuild components to build the circuit.
