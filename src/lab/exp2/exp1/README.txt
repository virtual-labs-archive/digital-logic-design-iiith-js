The tool consist of mainly two pannels: Left Pannel, Right Pannel.

    Left Pannel:You can change the settings from the left pane.

        Frequency Input:The frequency input changes the frequency of the oscillator named as OSC on the simulation panel

        If you get stuck, and are not able to make the state diagram, then load 2bit state diagram and 3bit state diagram buttons will help you out.

        Click the "Clear Workspace" button to clear the simulation.

    Right Pannel: The right pane contains the workspace where you will simulate your experiment.

        The toolbox on the left contains the pre-made logic circuits you will require to build a state diagram.

        Drag them on the right, to place them on your breadboard.

        The left part of the abstracted circuit contains the inputs, and the right side the outputs.

        Click on the circle of the input or output to another input/output to make a connection.
        You can connect only one line to an input, but an output can have multiple lines.

        The "DC" icon outputs digital 1 at all times, connnect it to:

            -push on: to simulate the 1 only when you're pressing on the button

            -push off: to simulate 0 when you're pushing the button

            -toggle: to toggle the output between 1 and 0.

        The OSC supplies 1 and 0 in a specific frequency which you set in the settings pane.

        The joint icon is just a connection, to make your connections look neater, as the lines from an output to an input are straight.

        The DSO displays the output in a graph format for easy verification. It has 8 inputs, you can choose to use any number of them. If you want more, just drag drop more of them.
