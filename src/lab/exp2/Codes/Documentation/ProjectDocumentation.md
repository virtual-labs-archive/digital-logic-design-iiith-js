# Experiment Project Documentation
---
## Introduction
This  document captures the technical details related to the experiment development.

## Project
**Domain Name :** Computer Science & Engineering

**Lab Name :** Digital Logic Design Lab

**Experiment Name :** Mulitplexer

In electronics, a multiplexer or mux is a device that selects one of several analog or digital input signals and forwards the selected input into a single line. Multiplexers were logically designed and used as electronic selector switches. A multiplexer of 2n inputs has n select lines, which are used to select which input line to send to the output.Multiplexers are mainly used to increase the amount of data that can be sent over the network within a certain amount of time and bandwidth. 


## Purpose of the project
 1 With The help of Theory Page , try to build the Multiplexer Circuit.
 2 First of all build the 2 X 1 Multiplexer.
 3 Then use it to build the 8 X 1 multiplexer.

## Process Followed to convert the experiment
1. Understand the assigned experiment Java simulation
2. Understanding the experiment concept
3. Re-implement the same in javascript

## Value Added by our Project
1. It would be beneficial for students studying Electronics and Communication and Digital Electronics to have an easy interaction understanding using simcir.js library.

## Risks and Challenges
1. Creating the web page screen responsive and proper styling for various dimension screens.
2. Creating the transition features.
3. Understanding the installation of prerequisites.
4. Adding required functionalities.
