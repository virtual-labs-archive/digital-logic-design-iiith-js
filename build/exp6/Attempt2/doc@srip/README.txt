DLD | issue no 287 | Latches and Flip-Flops

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Simulator:
The Simulator index can be used by clicking the index.html file.
The simulator can directly be used by opening the sample.html file.

The following are the files used for the simulator:

get_and_set.html
simcir.js
simcir-basicset.css
simcir-basicset.js


The following are the libraries used for the simulator:

simcir-library.js
jQuery
bootstrap.min.js
lodash.js
p5.dom.js
p5.js
p5.min.js
stickUp.min.js

PROCEDURE

On the simulator page, there are the basic logic gates along with abstracted universal gates. Several io components like 7 segment, 16 segment display, rotary encoders etc.
Adder, Subracter, JK, RS flip flops can be directly used as ICs as well.

Procedure for using the simulator:

1. Choose a device from the toolbox and move to right side.

2. Connect them by drag operation.

3. Click an input node to disconnect.

4. Move a device back to the toolbox if you don't use.

5. Ctrl+Click(Mac:command+Click) to toggle view (Live circuit or JSON data).

6. Double-Click a label to edit device name.

7. Double-Click a library to open the circuit inside.

8. For simulating logic gates, use a dc source followed by a toggle switch as input and an LED indicating the output

9. Intuitively, LED - ON will correspond to logic HIGH, and OFF will correspond to logic LOW

10. This is only what a fraction of what you can do with the simulator. Feel free to fiddle around.
